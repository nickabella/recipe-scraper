## About
Utilize [recipe-scraper](https://github.com/hhursev/recipe-scrapers) for use in an iOS shortcut.

## Execution
Code checks if the supplied recipe website is supported or not.
If no, Wild card is True.
If it returns an error, a link to [JustTheRecipe](https://www.justtherecipe.com/) is supplied.
Once shortcut is complete, a new Apple Note is created and the text is copied to the clipboard for pasting in order to maintain rich text.
